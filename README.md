Student Management System
This is a C program designed to efficiently manage student information using a linked list data structure. The project was created as part of the Standard Embedded Systems Diploma by Edges For Training.

Features
The system allows users to perform the following operations through a simple menu-driven interface:

Add a Student: Collects and adds new student details (ID, name, age, GPA) to the system.

Display All Students: Shows a list of all student records currently in the linked list.

Search for a Student by ID: Finds and displays the details of a specific student.

Update Student Information: Modifies the name, age, or GPA of an existing student.

Delete a Student: Removes a student's record from the system using their ID.

Calculate Average GPA: Computes and displays the average GPA of all students.

Find Student with Highest GPA: Identifies and displays the details of the student with the highest GPA.

Exit: Terminates the program.

Technical Details
Language: C

Data Structure: The system utilizes a linked list to store and manage student data dynamically.

Core Concepts: The project demonstrates the use of fundamental C programming concepts, including:

struct for defining data records.

Pointers for linked list implementation.

while loops for the main menu.

Conditional statements (if/else) for menu option selection and error handling.

Functions for modularity and code organization.
